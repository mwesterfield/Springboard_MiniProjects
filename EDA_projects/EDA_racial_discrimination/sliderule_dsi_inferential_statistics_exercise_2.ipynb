    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value. Try using both the bootstrapping and the frequentist statistical approaches.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "In the data from the Bertrand & Mullainathan study, potential employers were sent resumes from (fictional) applicants with black- and white-sounding names, and the researchers recorded whether or not the applicant was selected for an interview. Whereas 9.6% of 'white' applicants were selected for an interview, only 6.4% of the 'black' applicants were selected. Both the bootstrap and frequentist analyses above indicate that this difference is real, and unlikely to have occurred by chance. Because the researchers controlled for other factors (by sending both high and low quality resumes from both 'black' and 'white' applicants to each employer), it is plausible that it is the applicant's perceived race itself that directly impacts the callback rate. If this study is an accurate representation of how  employers truly behave when selecting potential job candidates, this result shows that there is a tangible cost to having a 'black' sounding name. Three fewer black applicants per hundred are selected for interviews than white candidates. "

The Betrand & Mullainathan study involved sending 'high quality' and 'low quality' resumes to potential employers, and presumably the factors that contributed to a 'high quality' resume should also have been important to callback success. In fact, doing a median split on an individual factor and then calculating the callback proportion for the high and low subgroups (not shown) indicates that higher callback rates may be associated with more years of experience, with higher 'occupation specific' scores, and with higher 'occupation-broad' scores (I did not actually test whether these varying scores significantly affected callback rates).\n",
